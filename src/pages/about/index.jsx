            My goal is to start applying to jobs by April. I want to finish my project, make sure my
            other projects are in top shape to put them on the portfolio. I also deleted all social
            media from my phone, this has helped me tremendously to focus and not compare myself to
            others. Social media is very toxic if you do not know how to use it. It affects your
            mental state. I only use Twitter on my computer just for updates, networking, and
            talking to my coding friends. I read LinkedIn has been a huge asset for other
            developers. My goal is to start applying to jobs by April. I want to finish my project,
            make sure my other projects are in top shape to put them on the portfolio.
